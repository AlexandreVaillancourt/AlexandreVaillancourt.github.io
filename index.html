			<h1>About Me</h1> <!-- the "h1" tag is for a top-level header -->
			<p>My name is Alexandre Vaillancourt. I manage cultural projects in Hull, QC. I'm working towards bringing more diversity and variety in our local scene. 
				I'm having fun organizing comedy shows, music concerts, arts & crafts markets and all types of festivals</p> <!-- the "p" tag is for text -->
			<h2>Why</h2> <!-- the "h2" tag is for a second-level header -->
			<p>I like to see people gathering around a common interest. Feels like you have a special bond with everybody in the room. 
				This feeling is sometimes hard to find here in Gatineau. We are lacking venues that allow the crowd to jump around and let loose.
			It's almost impossible to run a small venue here withou relying on beer sales</p>
			<h2>How</h2>
			<p>I think about event ideas. Put them on paper. Find people that are interested to help make it happen and make it happen. 
				Sometimes with public funds, sometimes without.
